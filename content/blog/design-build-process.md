You have an idea. Maybe it's a pool that disappears into the landscape. A pumptrack your kids will ride every day. A backyard transformation that makes your property the destination you've always imagined.

How does that idea become reality?

The gap between vision and completion is where design-build happens. It's not magic, but it is a process that requires experience, communication, and craftsmanship at every stage.

Here's what working with Valley Design Build actually looks like.

## Phase 1: Initial Conversation

Every project starts with talking.

**What We Ask**

Our first conversation explores the basics:

- What do you want to create? (Even vague answers work—"something amazing for the kids" tells us plenty)
- Who will use it? (Ages, abilities, interests)
- What's the property like? (Existing features, constraints, opportunities)
- What's the timeline? (Some projects have hard deadlines; others are open-ended)
- What's the investment range? (We work across budgets, but alignment matters)

**What You Should Ask**

Questions that help you evaluate us:

- Can you show examples of similar projects?
- Who would be working on our project?
- What's your typical timeline for projects like this?
- How do you handle unexpected issues during construction?
- What makes you different from other contractors?

**After the Call**

If there's mutual interest, we schedule a site visit. No charge, no obligation. We need to see your property to give you real answers.

## Phase 2: Site Visit and Discovery

We come to you.

**What We're Evaluating**

On-site, we assess:

- **Access** - How do equipment and materials reach the work area?
- **Utilities** - Where are electrical, water, and gas lines?
- **Drainage** - How does water currently move across the property?
- **Views** - What should be preserved, enhanced, or screened?
- **Sun exposure** - How do shadows move through the day and seasons?
- **Existing features** - What stays, what goes, what integrates?
- **Neighboring properties** - Setbacks, privacy, noise considerations

**What We're Listening For**

More important than measurements is understanding:

- How does your family actually use outdoor space now?
- What frustrates you about your current backyard?
- What would success look like? How would you describe the finished project to friends?
- Are there features you've seen elsewhere that inspire you?
- What would make you say "this was absolutely worth it"?

**The Follow-Up**

Within a week, we provide a preliminary scope and rough investment range. This isn't a formal proposal—it's a reality check. Does what's possible align with what you're hoping to invest?

If yes, we move to design.

## Phase 3: Design Development

This is where vision takes shape.

**Concept Design**

We start with possibilities:

- Multiple approaches to your project
- Rough layouts showing options
- Reference images for materials and finishes
- Initial thinking on features and flow

Concept design is exploratory. Some ideas won't work. Others will spark "yes, that" moments. The conversation narrows toward what resonates.

**Schematic Design**

Focused direction gets detailed:

- Scaled drawings of the preferred approach
- 3D renderings showing the experience (when helpful)
- Material selections and options
- Feature specifications
- Integration with existing landscape

You see what we're building before we build it. Revisions happen now, when they're drawings instead of concrete.

**Design Review**

We present the design for approval:

- Walking through every element
- Explaining construction approaches
- Discussing alternatives where options exist
- Confirming the vision matches what you imagined

Design approval means we share an understanding of what's being built.

## Phase 4: Proposal and Contract

Numbers and commitments.

**What's in the Proposal**

Our proposals include:

- **Detailed scope** - Exactly what's included and excluded
- **Material specifications** - Specific products, not generic descriptions
- **Investment breakdown** - Costs organized by project phase
- **Timeline** - Start date, milestone dates, completion target
- **Payment schedule** - When payments are due and what triggers them
- **Warranty information** - What's covered and for how long

**What's Negotiable**

Scope is adjustable. Value engineering finds savings when budgets need trimming. Feature additions increase investment. We work with you to dial the project to where it needs to be.

**Contract Execution**

Once aligned, we execute a contract that protects everyone. No work begins until agreements are signed and initial payment is received.

## Phase 5: Permitting and Preparation

Before shovels move, paperwork moves.

**Permit Navigation**

Most projects require permits:

- Building permits for structures
- Electrical permits for lighting and equipment
- Plumbing permits for water features
- Grading permits for earthwork

We handle permit applications and coordinate inspections. Utah municipalities have different requirements—we know them.

**Material Ordering**

Long-lead items get ordered:

- Custom fabrication elements
- Specialty materials
- Equipment with extended delivery times

Planning ahead prevents construction delays.

**Site Preparation**

Getting your property ready:

- Utility marking and protection
- Access route establishment
- Material staging areas
- Neighbor communication (when appropriate)

## Phase 6: Construction

This is where the work happens.

**Demolition and Earthwork**

Out with the old, reshaping the new:

- Removing existing features
- Excavation for foundations and features
- Grading for drainage and elevation
- Rough utility installation

This phase is messy. Dust, equipment, and noise are temporary but unavoidable.

**Structural Work**

Building the bones:

- Foundation work
- Structural steel or framing
- Concrete pours for pools, patios, and features
- Plumbing and electrical rough-in

Inspections happen throughout. Building departments verify work before it gets covered.

**Feature Installation**

Elements take shape:

- Pool shell and finishing
- Water feature construction
- Pumptrack or skatepark surfacing
- Structure completion
- Equipment installation

This phase shows dramatic progress. Patience during earlier phases pays off with rapid visible change.

**Finishing**

The details that matter:

- Surface treatments and sealers
- Tile and coping installation
- Planting and irrigation
- Lighting fine-tuning
- Equipment startup and programming

Finishing transforms construction into completed spaces.

## Phase 7: Quality Review

We inspect before you do.

**Internal Walkthrough**

Our team reviews everything:

- Workmanship standards met
- All scope items complete
- Systems functioning correctly
- Site cleaned and restored

We don't invite you to see it until it's ready.

**Client Walkthrough**

Together, we review the project:

- Demonstrating all features and systems
- Explaining operation and maintenance
- Noting any items needing attention
- Creating a punch list if needed

Most walkthroughs are celebrations. Occasionally, items need refinement. We address everything before final completion.

## Phase 8: Project Completion

The handoff.

**Final Documentation**

You receive:

- As-built drawings showing what was constructed
- Equipment manuals and warranty information
- Maintenance guidelines
- Contact information for service needs

**Final Payment**

Project completion triggers final payment per contract terms.

**Warranty Period**

Our warranty covers:

- Workmanship defects
- Equipment issues
- Settling and adjustment (where applicable)

We stand behind our work. Problems are addressed promptly.

## The Relationship Continues

Completion isn't goodbye.

**Seasonal Service**

Some features need seasonal attention:

- Pool opening and closing
- Water feature winterization
- Ice rink installation and removal
- Equipment maintenance

We offer ongoing service for clients who want it.

**Future Projects**

Many clients return for additional work:

- Phase 2 of original plans
- New ideas that emerged
- Updates and additions
- Completely new projects

Once you've worked with us, you know what to expect.

## Timeline Reality

How long does all this take?

**Design Phase:** 4-8 weeks
Depends on project complexity and decision speed. Simple projects move faster. Complex designs need more iteration.

**Permitting:** 2-6 weeks
Varies by municipality and project type. Some permits take days; others take months.

**Construction:** 4-16 weeks
A simple pumptrack: 3-4 weeks. A complete backyard transformation with pool, features, and structures: 12-16 weeks.

**Total Timeline:** 3-6 months typical
From first conversation to project completion. Complex projects or permitting delays can extend this.

## Investment Expectations

What should you budget?

Projects span a wide range:

- **Single feature** (pumptrack, mini ramp, water feature): $25,000-$75,000
- **Pool with basic landscape**: $80,000-$150,000
- **Complete backyard transformation**: $150,000-$400,000
- **Estate-level projects**: $400,000+

We work with various budgets. The key is alignment between vision and investment from the start.
